= Open-Dolphin Lazybones templates

These project templates make it very easy to create new Open-Dolphin applications.

== Installation of Lazybones using gvm (Linux, OS/X)

Install gvm:

-----------
$ curl -s get.gvmtool.net | bash
-----------

Install lazybones:

-----------
$ gvm install lazybones
-----------

Add the following entry to your +$HOME/.lazybones/config.groovy+ file
(create the file if it isn't there):

-----------
bintrayRepositories = [
    "opendolphin/lazybones-templates"
]
-----------


== Installation of Lazybones without gvm
Grab the distribution from https://bintray.com/pkg/show/general/pledbrook/lazybones-templates/lazybones[Bintray], unpack it to a local directory, and then add its +bin+ directory to your PATH environment variable.

== Usage
Since Open-Dolphin is independent from any framework or library it can be used together with many frontend and backend technologies. This is the reason
why there is not just one single template for project creation. You can choose whether your project should be java or groovy based and you may also choose which technology you would like to use. Currently there is a template for JavaFX and a HTML5 frontend
is included in the _server_ submodule. Here is a list of all currently available templates:

* dolphin-client-javafx-groovy
* dolphin-client-javafx-java
* dolphin-combined-groovy
* dolphin-combined-java
* dolphin-gwt
* dolphin-server-groovy
* dolphin-server-java
* dolphin-server-webapp
* dolphin-server-webapp-angularjs
* dolphin-shared-groovy
* dolphin-shared-java

You can see this list with the command +lazybones list+.

The following sections will help you setup a new Open-Dolphin project. You will end up with a simple hello world GUI connected to the server.

=== Run Main Template
First let us create a new folder and cd into it

[source]
----
mkdir hello_dolphin
cd hello_dolphin
----

For our first example we will create a JavaFX client which will use a service of the server side to display a hello world greeting.
Therefore we need the following modules: +dolphin-client-javafx-java+, +dolphin-combined-java+, +dolphin-server-java+ and
+dolphin-shared-java+. Create the modules as follows (and confirm the questions for _group_, _version_ and _packageName_ with the +enter+ key):

[source]
----
lazybones create dolphin-client-javafx-java client
...
lazybones create dolphin-combined-java combined
...
lazybones create dolphin-server-java server
...
lazybones create dolphin-shared-java shared

----

Then cd into the +combined+ folder and you should see the familiar files of a gradle based project:

[source,shell]
----
build.gradle
gradle
gradle.properties
gradlew
gradlew.bat
settings.gradle
src
----



== Running the application

You can run the application in two modes: the _development_ mode and the _remote_ mode.

=== Development mode

To run it in _development_ mode make sure you are in the +combined+ folder. Then invoke:

-----
./gradlew :run
-----

which shows the hello dolphin GUI with an entry field for the name and _Greet_ button on it. Clicking the button will show a _Hey Duke_ greeting:

On the terminal you can watch the commands which are sent forth and back between client and server.

Running the application this way (especially with an IDE) is most convenient for development since it requires only one process to be started.

=== Remote mode

To run the application in remote mode you need to generate the +webapp+ module:

[source]
----
lazybones create dolphin-server-webapp webapp
----

This module contains an embedded Jetty server which will run the application's war file which got created from the
modules +shared+, +server+ and +webapp+.

* If still running from the development mode stop the JavaFX GUI now.

To run it in _remote_ mode open two terminals. In the first one cd into +webapp+ and invoke:
-----
./gradlew --info :jettyRun
-----

and in a second terminal cd into +client+ and invoke:

-----
./gradlew :run
-----

Note that the client and the server communication messages now appear separately in the client respectively server terminal.


=== HTML5 Frontend

If you would like to develop a HTML5 frontend the project template comes with an example in form of a JSP: +webapp/src/main/webapp/hellodolphin.jsp+
which you can use as a start. To try it out start jetty as described in the _remote mode_ :
-----
	./gradlew jettyRun
-----

And then point your browser to http://localhost:8080/appContext/hellodolphin.jsp which will show a page which looks very similar to the JavaFX GUI we
already saw:

== IDEs

=== IntelliJ IDEA

IntelliJ IDEA users simply choose +File/Import Project+ from the menu bar and then select +hello_dolphin/combined/build.gradle+.
This will open the _Import Project from Gradle_ dialog. Having confirmed the dialog you are ready to go.
To run the application open +ApplicationInMemoryStarter+ from +combined/src/main/java...+ and run it. This corresponds to
+./gradlew :run+ which we performed earlier for development mode.


=== Netbeans 8
I am an IntelliJ IDEA user and unfortunately could not quite figure out how to import the gradle based project into Netbeans. If anyone has some hints on how to
do it properly please let me know. This is what I found so far:
Netbeans 8 users need to install the _Gradle Support_ plugin via +Tools/Plugins+. After restarting the IDE simply choose +File/Open Project+ from the menu bar and then select the +hello_dolphin+ folder which already carries the _gradle_ icon. At this point unfortunately Netbeans complains that it cannot find the _:shared_ module although it
works on the commandline and in IntelliJ IDEA.

=== Eclipse
In the +hello_dolphin/combined+ folder invoke +./gradlew eclipse+. Start Eclipse and choose +File/Import+ from the menu bar and then +General/Existing Projects into Workspace+. Then select +hello_dolphin+ as the root directory and make sure to have selected the _Search for nested projects_ checkbox:

image::doc/eclipse_import_project_1.png[]


Press the _Finish_ button, open +ApplicationInMemoryStarter+ from the _combined_ project and run it. This should bring up the familiar Hello Dolphin GUI.

Note that if you are not using JDK 8 but JDK 7 you might need to add the JavaFX jar +JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/jfxrt.jar+ to your classpath.

=== Conclusion

Now you have a running Open-Dolphin project setup which you can use to develop your application.
For more information have a look at the http://open-dolphin.org/[Open-Dolphin webpage] and the Jumpstart tutorial at https://github.com/canoo/DolphinJumpStart[DolphinJumpStart]

== Additional Information

If you would like to pass the value for _moduleName_ on the commandline use the +-P+ parameter:
-----
lazybones create -Pgroup=org.mygroup dolphin-server-java server
-----

In case something went wrong during the application of the template setting the loglevel might help:
-----
lazybones --logLevel=FINE ...
-----

=== Gradle Project Structure
To tie the individual modules togher to form an application we use http://www.gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/multi_project_builds.html[gradle's multi project build facility] but adapted it a bit so
that the root project does not have to be located in the top level folder but can be inside one of the modules like +combined+ or +client+.
Have a look at the +combined/settings.gradle+ and +combined/build.gradle+ for example to see how they depend on each other.
If necessery you can then adjust the dependencies according to your needs.

Note that this way it is possible to have the individual project folders in any location you like. Technically each project is a multi module project and you can import each of them into your IDE where the dependent projects appear as well.

=== Documentation to Other Open-Dolphin Templates

* link:doc/gwt.adoc[Open-Dolphin GWT Template]
* link:doc/angularjs.adoc[Open-Dolphin AngularJS Template]

=== Template Development Instructions

* Make a change in a template, e.g. +templates/dolphin-client-javafx-java+
* In the top folder execute +./gradlew installTemplateXYZ+ which will install the template into +~/.lazybones/templates/XYZ....zip+
* In an arbitrary directory execute +lazybones createXYZ 0.0.6 <modulename>+ which will create the folder +<modulename>+ and expand the template into it.
* Test the generated module and repeat the previous steps until you are satisfied with the result

== Publishing
* In the top level folder invoke +./gradlew publishTemplateXYZ+ . Note: the first time a package needs to be created with the bintray Web-GUI in the 'lazybones-templates' repository with a name ending in '-template' (e.g. 'open-dolphin-javafx-java-template').
