= Open-Dolphin AngularJS Template

Use this project template if you would like to combine Open-Dolphin with AngularJS.

You can find an example project which was built using this template at https://github.com/svene/open-dolphin-examples/tree/master/od_angular_js

== Usage Instructions

* If not done already install `lazybones` as described here in https://github.com/canoo/open-dolphin-lazybones-templates/blob/master/README.adoc
* Create a new empty folder (say `hello_dolphin`) and cd into it
* In `hello_dolphin` first create the shared and server projects by invoking (confirm all questions with enter):
** `lazybones create dolphin-shared-java shared`
** `lazybones create dolphin-server-java server`
* And then also in `hello_dolphin` create a new project folder for angular by invoking
** `lazybones create dolphin-server-webapp-angularjs webapp`
* cd into the `webapp` folder and execute `./gradlew --info :appRun`. Wait until you see the message _Running at http://localhost:8080/appContext_
* point your browser at `http://localhost:8080/appContext/helloangular.jsp`. The well known greet page should appear. Put a name in the text field and press the greet button.

This should give you a start into using Open-Dolphin together with AngularJS.
