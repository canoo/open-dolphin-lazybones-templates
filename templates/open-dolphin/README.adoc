==============================
New Open Dolphin Project got created.

Next:
<% if ('.' != ARG_PROJECT_DIR_NAME) { %>- cd ${ARG_PROJECT_DIR_NAME}<% } %>
- generate the subprojects by either running 'setup_for_java.sh' or 'setup_for_groovy.sh'
- ./gradlew :combined:run

  which should bring up a window with a button. When you click it you should see the OpenDolphin communication messages in the terminal.

Now you are set up to develop your Open Dolphin Application !
